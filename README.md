# Reaction Wheel Model
Simulation and analysis of a reaction wheel

## Brief

* The electric part is modeled as a DC motor, but BLDC model will be added in the future
* Simple sensor models adding white Gaussian Noise
* Step and PWM input signals for test
* Analysis tools for real and simulated data
* Parameter optimization for first order plus dead time model
